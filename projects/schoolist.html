          Busy parents face numerous challenges when it comes to school shopping for their children. The process of finding and purchasing school supplies can be time-consuming, overwhelming, and often involves visiting multiple stores or dealing with cumbersome online shopping platforms. Additionally, the lack of centralized information and limited visibility into product availability and pricing can lead to inefficiencies and frustration for parents.<br><br>

By streamlining the entire school shopping experience, Schoolist saves parents valuable time and effort, enabling them to focus on other responsibilities while ensuring their children have all the necessary supplies for a successful academic year.

        <div class="description">
          I sketched multiple user flows of wireframes to visualize ideas quickly. My focus at this stage was to diverge first, converge later. Here are some early low fidelity wireframes mimicking the user flow.

          This is a simplified show of how a user navigates the Schoolist app. I minimised the entry 
          points to ensure that there is a clear flow of events. There are minimal chances that users 
          get lost in the app.

        <h2 class="heading">I went through 20+ iterations</h2>
        <div class="description">
          The initial designs went through several user tests, discussions with family, students, parents and strangers to ensure 
          we have a friendly and scalable user experience. I wish I could show you every single part of the process!<br><br>

          To validate our designs or test prototypes, I did guerrilla testing with real users. I did this in-person
          I've tested the prototype with 30+ people in a controlled testing environment as well as the guerilla way.
