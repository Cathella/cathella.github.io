          Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am Nakitto Catherine. A ReactJS developer, 
          a Ruby on Rails developer and a UI/UX designer.<br><br>

          I have trained at Microverse, an online training school, 
          where we pair-programmed and built projects together remotely. 
          I acquired teamwork and good communication skills from coding 
          daily with other developers worldwide.<br><br>

          I'm a passionate web designer and developer with a love for creating 
          beautiful and functional websites and applications. I've been working 
          in the industry for years, and I'm proud to say that I've honed my 
          skills to a fine art.<br><br>

          What I love most about my work is the opportunity to solve problems 
          and create solutions that truly make a difference for my clients. 
          Whether it's designing an intuitive user interface or developing a 
          complex application, I'm always up for a challenge.<br><br>

          As a creative problem solver, I enjoy working closely with clients to 
          understand their unique needs and create solutions that exceed their 
          expectations. Communication is key to success in any project, and I'm 
          always happy to go the extra mile to ensure that my clients are happy 
          with the end result.<br><br>

          When I'm not designing or coding, you can find me exploring the great 
          outdoors or curled up with a good book. I'm always seeking new adventures 
          and experiences, both personally and professionally.<br><br>

          If you're looking for a web designer and developer who's passionate, 
          creative, and dedicated to delivering high-quality work, look no further 
          than me! Let's work together to bring your vision to life.
