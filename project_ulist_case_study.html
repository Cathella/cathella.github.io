        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="content">
          UList is an e-commerce platform that aims to simplify the back-to-school 
          shopping experience for students and parents alike. 
          With UList, users can create customized shopping lists for all their 
          school-related needs using a web or mobile application. 
          The platform offers a user-friendly interface that enables customers to 
          easily browse through a wide range of products and add items to their lists.<br><br>

          Once the user has compiled their shopping list, UList takes care of the rest, 
          sourcing the items on the list and delivering them to the user's doorstep, 
          eliminating the need for tedious trips to the store or shops.<br><br>
          
          UList is the perfect solution for busy parents and students who want to save 
          time and avoid the hassle of shopping for school supplies.<br><br>
        </div>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <div class="content">
          The problem that UList is aiming to solve is the stressful and time-consuming process of 
          back-to-school shopping for students and parents. Traditionally, this process involves 
          traveling to multiple stores, browsing through a variety of products, and manually 
          creating a shopping list. This can be overwhelming, especially for busy parents who 
          are juggling work and family responsibilities.<br><br>
        </div>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <div class="content">
          UList's goal is to simplify this process by providing a user-friendly platform where users 
          can easily create customized shopping lists and have their items delivered to their doorstep. 
          This not only saves time but also reduces the stress associated with back-to-school shopping.<br><br>
        </div>
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <div class="content">
          Since UList is a new product on the market, tracking metrics is important to showcase its impact and success by 
          providing evidence of the platform's effectiveness and potential for growth in the future.<br><br>
        </div>
        <h3>1. User Adoption</h3>
        <div class="content">
          UList could aim to reach 10,000 users in its first year of operation, with a goal of increasing this 
          number by 50% in the second year. By the end of the second year, UList would have 15,000 registered users.<br><br>
        </div>
        <h3>2. Customer Satisfaction</h3>
        <div class="content">
          UList could conduct customer satisfaction surveys and aim for a satisfaction rating of 4 out of 5. 
          This would indicate that users find the platform to be easy to use and helpful for simplifying 
          the back-to-school shopping process.<br><br>
        </div>
        <h3>3. Conversion Rates</h3>
        <div class="content">
          UList could aim for a conversion rate of 20%, meaning that one out of every five users who creates 
          a shopping list on the platform goes on to complete a purchase. This would represent a significant 
          impact on the back-to-school shopping market<br><br>
        </div>
        <h3>4. Repeat Users</h3>
        <div class="content">
          UList could aim for a repeat user rate of 30%, meaning that three out of every ten users return 
          to the platform for future back-to-school shopping needs. This would demonstrate that users 
          find the platform to be a valuable and reliable resource.<br><br>
        </div>
        <h3>5. Delivery Times</h3>
        <div class="content">
          UList could aim for an average delivery time of 1 business day for items on users' 
          shopping lists. This would ensure that items are delivered in a timely manner and would 
          contribute to a positive user experience.<br><br>

          By achieving these estimated values, UList would have a significant impact on the back-to-school 
          shopping market, helping to simplify the process for students and parents and saving them time and stress.<br><br>
        </div>
        <h2>Our Users</h2>
        <div class="content">
          Before designing started, focus was directed to identifying who the customers of UList 
          would be and how they would genuinely use the app. Two user archetypes were identified 
          through UX research.<br><br>
        </div>
        <h3>1. Students</h3>
        <div class="content">
          Students would use UList to create customized shopping lists for their back-to-school needs. 
          They would browse through a wide range of products and add items to their lists using the 
          platform's user-friendly interface. Once their shopping list is complete, they would submit 
          it to UList for sourcing and delivery.<br><br>
